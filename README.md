An example of a .NET Core library that uses:

- [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) for testing
- [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) for mutation testing
- [Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) for code coverage
- and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html) for... CI.

# Releases

Can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://gitlab.com/reductech/templates/dotnetlibrary/-/releases).

# NuGet Packages

Are available for download from the [Releases page](https://gitlab.com/reductech/templates/dotnetlibrary/-/releases)
or from the `package nuget` jobs of the CI pipelines. They're also available in:

- [Reductech Nuget feed](https://gitlab.com/reductech/nuget/-/packages) for releases
- [Reductech Nuget-dev feed](https://gitlab.com/reductech/nuget-dev/-/packages) for releases, master branch and dev builds

# How to use this template

## When creating a new project in GitLab

1. Go to *Create from template* tab
2. Select *Group*
3. Select *Reductech / templates*
4. And finally, select *DotNetLibrary*

## Once you've cloned the project

### 1. Run the handy script to rename the project and solution

```powershell
.\Rename-Template.ps1 -Name 'NewProjectName' -Namespace 'Reductech.Utilities'
```

### 2. Add a couple of things

- *Project/Project.csproj*:
   1. Check that the *RootNamespace*, *AssemblyName* and *PackageId* have been correctly updated
   2. Fill in these properties
      - Title
      - Description
      - Product
      - PackageTags - this needs to be a semicolon-separated list
   3. Check that the new urls have been correctly updated

- *Project.Tests/Project.Tests.csproj*:
   1. Check that the *RepositoryUrl* has been correctly updated

- *.gitlab-ci.yml*
   1. Update *PACKAGE_NAME_NUGET* and *PACKAGE_NAME_DLL* if you would like
   the downloadable artifacts to have a name other than the project name.

- *.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature.md* and *.gitlab/issue_templates/Bug.md*
   1. Update the epic in the template to the one that tracks your project issues.
   2. Optional. Update the labels to better suit your project.
   The `area::core` label should be changed to the area the project mostly works on.

### 3. Commit and clean-up

```
Remove-Item -Path .\Rename-Template.ps1
git commit -a -m "Rename template"
git clean -fdx
dotnet restore
```
And you're ready.

# Versioning

The CI jobs that are responsible for the nuget package versions
are `version check dev` and `version check release`.

This job adds the following environment variables to any subsequent jobs:

| Variable | Description |
| :------: | :---------- |
| PROJECT_VERSION | This is the `Version` property of the *csproj* file. Test projects are ignored. If more than one non-test project exists, the last project's version is used. |
| VERSION_SUFFIX | This is generated by the job and will be appended to the project version. |
| VERSION_TIMESTAMP | Time of the build in epoch format. It's used as a build version. |

> :exclamation: This job will fail a release pipeline if a release tag does not match the version number.

## VersionSuffix

The *VersionSuffix* consists of:

- A pre-release suffix: if the project version already has a pre-release suffix
(e.g. *alpha*, *rc*) then that's used, otherwise the suffix defined by the
`DEFAULT_PRERELEASE_VERSION` CI variable is used.
- Either '.master' on the *master* branch, or '.dev' for all other commits
- The version timestamp

If the *Version* in the csproj file is `1.1.0`:

- A build for a merge request, will have version number `1.1.0-a.dev.1501663740`
- A build on the *master* branch will have version number `1.1.0-a.master.1501663740`
- A release build will have version `1.1.0`

If the *Version* in the csproj file is `1.1.0-beta`:

- A build for a merge request, will have version number `1.1.0-beta.dev.1501663740`
- A build on the *master* branch will have version number `1.1.0-beta.master.1501663740`
- A release build will have version `1.1.0-beta`

# The CI pipeline

Is defined to run for:

- All commits for the master branch
- Merge request commits
- All tags

## Stages and jobs

The CI pipeline has five stages:

- build
- test
- quality
- package
- push

Each stage has one or more jobs, most have at least two because
of development and release jobs. The major differences between
*dev* and *release* jobs are:

- Project is built using `Debug` configuration for *dev* and `Release` for *release*
- The development nuget feed *nuget-dev* is used for *dev* and the release feed *nuget* for *release*
- Artifacts never expire for *release* jobs

### build

Does a restore and a build using either the `Debug` or `Release` configuration.
Stores packages and build output, and makes it available to all
subsequent jobs, so that the restore and build only has to take place once.

The jobs in this stage will use different nuget feeds - so a build
will only be successful if it's using packages available in the
dev/release feed. This means that release packages can only be built
using other release packages.

### test

Runs `dotnet test` using either the `Debug` or `Release` configuration.
Requires `coverlet.collector` to get code coverage metrics.
*Coverlet* produces a `coverage.cobertura.xml` report, and a script
is then used to retrieve code coverage metrics from this report. The
script also fixes compatibility issues with GitLab and the way *coverlet*
outputs paths.

[More info on the *cobertura* reports and test coverage visualization.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/test_coverage_visualization.html)

The *version check* jobs are also run as part of the test stage.
If a release project version does not match the release tag, this stage fails.

### quality

Runs the gitlab [code_quality](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html#code-quality)
job and mutation testing. Both are optional for all but the master branch.

Mutation testing uses [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) and produces
a Mutation Report which is made available in Merge Requests.

### package

Creates a nuget and dll package for the project using either the
`Debug` or `Release` configuration. There are three nuget jobs, one
for dev, master, and release. Dev and master both use the `Debug`
configuration, but the master branch artifacts never expire. Release
uses the `Release` configuration and its artifacts never expire.

On release branches, an additional job runs that creates a package
of the library dll. This is made available for download on the
releases page.

### push

Contains jobs that push the nuget package to the reductech nuget feeds.

- Releases are pushed to both *nuget* and *nuget-dev*
- Master branch builds are pushed to *nuget-dev*
- Dev builds are also pushed to *nuget-dev*

The properties that need to be updated:

- RepositoryUrl

> :notepad_spiral: `IsTestProject` is explicitly set because of issues with cross-platform builds.
